FENUtility
==========

Forsythâ€“Edwards Notation (FEN) is a standard notation for describing a particular board position of a chess game.

Our shortened FEN notation takes 3 fields:

1. Piece placement

2. Active colour

3. Castling Availibilty

|

For example a valid FEN string for standard chess would be "rnbqkbnr/pppppppp/8/8/8/8/PPPPPPPP/RNBQKBNR w KQkq"

.. class:: class FenUtility(val FENstring: String)

    Takes a FENstring and checks the correctness when initialised. Throws ``IllegalArgumentException`` if the FENstring is not valid.
Optional parameter args

    ``Int whiteStartingRow`` - the starting row of the white pawn from which they can move 2 steps

    ``Int whitePromotionRow`` - the row at which the white pawn will be promoted 

    ``Int blackStartingRow`` - the starting row of the white pawn from which they can move 2 steps

    ``Int blackPromotionRow`` - the row at which the white pawn will be promoted

    ``List<KFunction1<Player, Piece2D>> pawnPromotions`` - a list of pieces a pawn can be promoted to 

.. function:: fun initBoardWithFEN(board: Board2D, player1: Player, player2: Player)

  Takes a board and initialises it with the FENstring's piece placement. Throws ``IllegalArgumentException`` if the piece placement does not fit the size of the board.

.. method:: val activeColour: Int
Returns the activeColour from the FENstring

.. method:: val p1CanCastleLeft: Int
.. method:: val p1CanCastleRight: Int
.. method:: val p2CanCastleLeft: Int
.. method:: val p2CanCastleRight: Int
Returns the castling availibilty for left and right side castling for black and white
