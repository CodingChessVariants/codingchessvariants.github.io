Initialise Game and set up Board
***************************

Board2D has already been implemented. If your game is 2D and rectangular, you may just use this board. Otherwise, you will need to create your own board.

To create your own board, implement the Board interface. Please refer to the Board Engine API pages for details on how to implement the methods.
